# lum.compat.js

As the libraries grow over time, features can change a lot, and backwards
compatibility is not always easy to maintain.

This package will act as a compatibility helper when migrating between major
versions of my other `@lumjs` packages.

## Branches

### `main`

The current development branch for the upcoming `2.x` releases.

### `v1.x`

The old branch that covered versions `1.0.0` through `1.4.0`.
